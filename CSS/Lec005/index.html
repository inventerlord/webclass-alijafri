        The Color Picker Tool is used to select a color on any image opened on your
         screen. By clicking a point on an image, you can change the active color to
          that which is located under the pointer. By default, the tool works on the 
          active layer, but the Sample Merge option lets you grab the color as it is
           in the image, resulting of the combination of all layers. Only colors in 
           visible layers are used. An Info window opens when you click on the image.
